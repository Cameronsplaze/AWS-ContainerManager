# GitHub Actions

**GitHub Actions Docs/References:**

- The GOOD docs on [writting workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions) that I can never find when I need.
- Docs on [context](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-what-your-workflow-does/accessing-contextual-information-about-workflow-runs)'s (i.e ${{ github.* }}, and other built-in variables)

## Dependabot Auto-Updates

There's a lot of tweaks I had to do to get this working. Will come back to at some point and re-write this readme. To include:

- Disabled PR code having to be up to date with base. If two dependabot PRs are open at the same time, the second one will fail to merge.
  - We can technically get around this by setting the max-pr to 1 in each config block, then having each block run a different day of the week. This feels really hacky though...
- Added [CODEOWNERS](../CODEOWNERS) file, but had to disable on the files dependabot touches. There's no way to add apps to CODEOWNERS. (More details in the CODEOWNERS file itself.).
- Added a list of required actions to Branch Protections Rules for `main`. When dependabot waits to auto-merge, it'll only wait for **required** actions to finish.
  - They also can't contain the `on.<trigger>.paths` key. If they do, and the paths isn't in the PR, you won't be able to merge it. (It just freezes saying "Expected â€” Waiting for status to be reported")
- In [dependabot.yml](../dependabot.yml), added a `groups` section. This makes all updates happen under a single PR. That way if 3 updates get created, you don't merge all 3 at the same time and try to do 3 deployment updates at once.

## main-pipeline-cdk.yml

On PR's, it synths all the cdk stacks, and when merged, will deploy them to main.

- It's specifically designed to synth on PR's, and deploy on push's, but not vise-versa. This way when it merges to main, you're not trying to synth and deploying at the same time. (synth-ing THEN deploying is pointless, since it had to successfully synth to be merged in the first place...).
- These run on PR's even though they only have a `push` trigger, because of how GH does commits behind the scenes. I have these all listed as `required` in the branch protection rules, so GH will still wait for them to finish before letting you merge the branch.

## Automatic Deployments: Whitelisting/Adding a Container

I made this different than `cdk-synth`. For synth, it should run on EVERY config to make sure they always work. For deploy, it'll change randomly depending on what games you find fun at the time (update `DEPLOY_EXAMPLES` to **add** stacks, or **delete** with the `dispatch-delete-leaf-stack.yaml` action).

1) Add a new line to the **Github Variable** `DEPLOY_EXAMPLES`. Each line is the filename for a config **inside** `./Examples/` in this repo. For example, it might contain:

    ```txt
    Minecraft.java.example.yaml
    Valheim.example.yaml
    ```

    **NOTE**: If you deploy *manually*, the `container-id` will be `minecraft.java.example`. If the *pipeline* does it though, I made it default to everything left of the first period (i.e here, just `minecraft`). This is to keep the urls short, and also not conflict with manual deployments by default.

    - This means `minecraft.java.example` and `minecraft.bedrock.example` will conflict by default. I figured no one wants both running at once, and there's away to override this if you do.
    - You can override this by adding `CONTAINER_ID` as either a **secret** or **variable** in your Github Environment.

2) Create a new Github Environment, with the same name as the line you added. For example, `Minecraft.java.example.yaml`.

3) Inside that environment, you can create any number of variables / secrets specific to that deployment. Since they're apart of the environment, they won't be exposed to the other containers either. They'll be *environment variables* when the action deploys, so reference them directly in the `./Examples/<container>` yaml file. I.e:

    ```txt
    Github Secret: ${{ secrets.SERVER_PASS }}
    Or Variable: ${{ vars.SERVER_NAME }}
    ```

    Can be referenced in the yaml file as:

    ```yaml
    !ENV ${SERVER_PASS}
    !ENV ${SERVER_NAME}
    ```

    Technically to do this, **all** secrets/variables are turned into environment variables in the action. However, even if the container is untrusted, if you don't pass the env-vars to the container in the `./Examples/<container>` yaml file, it won't be able to see them.

**Finally**: If you decide to remove it to save money, you can just remove the one line from `DEPLOY_EXAMPLES`, then delete the stack. This lets you keep the environment around with all the variables, in case you want to re-deploy it later.

## Forking this Repo

I specifically designed all the automation, so that if it's forked, you can re-use it and customize it to your own needs without conflicting with the base. The way of doing this was relying on GitHub's secrets/variables when deploying.

1) Setup [AWS OIDC](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-hardening-your-deployments/configuring-openid-connect-in-amazon-web-services). How I do it personally is at [Cameronsplaze/AWS-OIDC](https://github.com/Cameronsplaze/AWS-OIDC). It's only one-per-account, so it can't be in this repo.

2) There's a couple steps inside [Dependabot Auto-updates](#dependabot-auto-updates) above you'll want to follow, like setting up branch protections with required actions.

3) **Secrets and variables: Actions Secrets** you'll want declared (in the 'core', NOT in any environment):

    - **AWS_ACCOUNT_ID**: Your AWS Account ID.
    - **DOMAIN_NAME**: The domain name of your Route53 Hosted Zone.
    - **HOSTED_ZONE_ID**: The ID of your Route53 Hosted Zone.
    - **EMAIL**: The email for receiving alerts for everything. (Might turn this into a list at some point, the yaml config supports that already anyways...)
    - **PAT_AUTOMERGE_PR**: The Personal Access Token for automerging PRs. If you used `GITHUB_TOKEN` instead, it wouldn't trigger other workflows when merged. Go to `Profile` -> `Settings` -> `Developer settings` -> `Personal access tokens`+`Fine-grained tokens` -> `Generate new token`. For permissions, only give it access to your fork, and you only need `Read & Write for Pull requests`.

4) **Secrets and variables: *Actions Variables*** you'll want declared (in the 'core', NOT in any environment):

    - **AWS_DEPLOY_ROLE**: The role to use with OIDC. (If you're using my repo, it's `github_actions_role`).
    - **AWS_REGION**: The region to deploy to. (Some HAS to be deployed to `us-east-1`, this is everything else that's not restricted).
    - **DEPLOY_EXAMPLES**: The list of container config paths to deploy, each on their own line. (See '[Automatic Deployments](#automatic-deployments-whitelistingadding-a-container)' for details).

5) **Secrets and variables: *Dependabot Secrets***: These are only accessible to dependabot, BUT dependabot can't access any of the github secrets above.

    - **PAT_AUTOMERGE_PR**: A *classic* PAT with ONLY `repo:public_repo` permissions. (Has to be classic until [this issue](https://github.com/cli/cli/issues/9166) is fixed. You'll get permission denied otherwise.) Create this under `Account` -> `Settings` -> `Developer Settings` -> `Personal Access Tokens` -> `Tokens (classic)`

6) Follow '[Automatic Deployments](#automatic-deployments-whitelistingadding-a-container)' for adding a new container to deploy. Can go through any number of times.
