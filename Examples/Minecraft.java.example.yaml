    ### Plugins List:
    # geysermc (geyser and floodgate): For letting Bedrock Clients connect to the server. (Including Mobile)
    #    - Each player needs to follow this guide to use bedrock: https://geysermc.org/wiki/floodgate/linking#what-is-global-linking
    ## NOTE: These CAN'T be the modrinth versions. We need the very latest, to let bedrock clients connect.
    #         (But ViaVersion/ViaBackwards should make it work with whatever java version the server is on)
