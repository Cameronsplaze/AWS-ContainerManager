# Running Tests

I'm hoping to write tests for this project real soon. Some core ideas to include:

- Tests for `./ContainerManager/utils/config_loader.py`. Make sure it parses everything correctly, and it checks for incorrect types passed in on all the parts.
- Tests for timing, see which part actually takes the longest to spin up.
